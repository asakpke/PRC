# PRC
PRC (PHP RAD CRUD) is a rapid application development (RAD) tool that makes it easy to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) database table records without writing much code. It's currently in beta mode, but we're planning to add more features in the future. In case you don't know, PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
